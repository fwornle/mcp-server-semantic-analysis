# Documentation Update - October 25, 2025

## Summary

Updated documentation to accurately reflect the actual implementation based on comprehensive code analysis. This document summarizes what was corrected.

## Key Findings

### 1. Agent Coordination

**Was Documented:**
- Coordinator only orchestrates between a few agents
- Agents call each other directly in sequence

**Now Corrected:**
- `CoordinatorAgent` orchestrates **ALL 10 agents** (9 worker agents) through workflow definitions
- Workflows define step-by-step execution with explicit dependencies
- Data flows through templating: `{{step_name.result}}`
- Example "complete-analysis" workflow:
  ```
  Coordinator orchestrates:
  → GitHistoryAgent (analyze commits)
  → VibeHistoryAgent (analyze conversations)
  → SemanticAnalysisAgent (correlate git + vibe data)
  → WebSearchAgent (external research)
  → InsightGenerationAgent (generate insights + diagrams)
  → ObservationGenerationAgent (create UKB observations)
  → QualityAssuranceAgent (validate outputs)
  → PersistenceAgent (save to knowledge base)
  → (DeduplicationAgent as needed)
  ```

**Source:** `src/agents/coordinator.ts` lines 78-200+

### 2. LLM Provider Usage

**Was Documented:**
- Only SemanticAnalysisAgent uses LLMs
- Shows single connection to LLM providers

**Now Corrected:**
- **Multiple agents use LLMs** via `SemanticAnalyzer`:
  - `InsightGenerationAgent` - Uses LLMs for diagram generation and pattern analysis
  - `QualityAssuranceAgent` - Likely uses LLMs for validation
  - `SemanticAnalysisAgent` - Core LLM usage for code analysis
  - Possibly others
- All LLM usage follows 3-tier provider chain:
  - Custom LLM (primary)
  - Anthropic Claude (secondary)
  - OpenAI GPT (fallback)

**Source:** `src/agents/insight-generation-agent.ts`, `src/agents/semantic-analyzer.ts`

### 3. Storage Architecture

**Was Documented:**
- "MCP Memory" as active storage component
- "Files" as vague storage concept
- "Graph" without clear explanation

**Now Corrected:**
- **THREE sync targets** managed by `SynchronizationAgent`:
  1. **`mcp_memory`** - Type defined but implementation appears to be placeholder/incomplete
     - References non-existent `knowledge_graph` agent
     - May not be functional in current system
  2. **`graphology_db`** - In-memory graph database (Graphology)
     - Active and functional
     - Bidirectional sync enabled
  3. **`shared_memory_file`** - Git-tracked JSON persistence
     - Path: `/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/shared-memory-coding.json`
     - Bidirectional sync enabled
     - This is the "Files" component

**Source:** `src/agents/synchronization.ts` lines 67-95, 176-200

## What Was Updated

### Updated Files

1. **`README.md`** (MCP Server)
   - ✅ Updated workflow diagram showing coordinator orchestrating ALL agents
   - ✅ Added legend showing which agents use LLMs (pink) vs no LLM (blue)
   - ✅ Corrected storage architecture with 3 sync targets
   - ✅ Added notes about MCP Memory placeholder status

2. **`docs/integrations/mcp-semantic-analysis.md`** (Main docs)
   - ✅ Reorganized agent list by type (Orchestration, Analysis, LLM-Powered, Infrastructure)
   - ✅ Added "Agent Coordination Model" section explaining workflow execution
   - ✅ Added example data flow showing templating mechanism
   - ✅ Clarified LLM provider chain
   - ✅ Fixed markdown linting issues

3. **`docs/puml/unified-semantic-architecture.puml`** (Regular docs diagram)
   - ✅ Vertical layout for documentation
   - ✅ Shows coordinator connecting to ALL 10 agents (9 workers)
   - ✅ Color-coded packages by agent type
   - ✅ Includes explanatory notes

4. **`docs/presentation/puml/unified-semantic-architecture.puml`** (Presentation diagram)
   - ✅ Narrower landscape layout for presentations
   - ✅ Grouped agents compactly
   - ✅ Shows coordinator orchestration clearly
   - ✅ Simplified labels for readability

## Outstanding Questions

- Is MCP Memory server actually running/used? (Code suggests placeholder)
- Is the "knowledge_graph" agent implemented? (Referenced in sync code but not found)
- Should MCP Memory be removed or completed?

## Code References

- Coordinator workflows: `src/agents/coordinator.ts`
- Storage sync: `src/agents/synchronization.ts`
- LLM usage: `src/agents/insight-generation-agent.ts`, `src/agents/semantic-analyzer.ts`
